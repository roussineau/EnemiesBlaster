# EnemiesBlaster: Play [here](https://roussineau.github.io/EnemiesBlaster/)
This is my very first videogame. All the basic assets for controls and camera were obtained in the MST & Coursera Game Design and Development 1: 2D Shooter (professor Brian Winn).

The final advice of the course was to try by ourselves how can we change things of the game they made in the videos, and make it more entertaining and atractive. Because I didn't have any knowledge about game developing, I started learning how to make real the ideas I wanted with LLM and GenAI models like ChatGPT and Claude Sonnet. This is the product of usind AI for learning to make C# scripts and implementing ideas that looked great in my mind. 

The most of the modifications I made can be read in this devlog I made while programming the game: https://roussineau.notion.site/enemies-blaster-devlog
